# open-governance

# A living spec draft

An open and transparent governance model with people and open-source technology at it's core.

`Because, in today's digital age, every willing citizen should have a role to play in the governance - from their home, office, or on the move and have more than just mere voting rights - To be able to interact, evaluate and be a part of the design in solving problems.`

## Prelude

Governance is a complicated, subjective and diverse subject, which only an elite few deal with in limelight, but everyone deals with in their own ways in one form or the other throughout their life - with time, money, family, children etc. But at the heart of it all, it can be broken down to a simple fact - We strive to make ourselves better - It could be in the form of protection, promotion, evolution, or revolution. It generally involves protecting our physical being, our ideologies or our beliefs, and involves tearing down a few to protect or create something else. The simple law of nature (well, it's the conversation of energy - but irrefutably applies to pretty much everything) - `Nothing in life, can be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred or changed from one form to another`. 

In that spirit, the fore-fathers of each country, religion or culture, at some point had put it in enormous effort and resources into creating streamlined processes, and rules, which eventually came out to be what we call as laws. However none of them were meant to be "permanent", as nothing in life really is. They simply did what seemed best to them with the data they had at that time, in that place, and for those people. And as such, we enjoy democracy in it's current form today. And as these things streamlined - it was also important to streamline when and who had the ability and the authority to make changes to different sections of the law - and as such, came into existence - our current form of government with it's representatives, lawyers, judges, and the teams around them. 

Why is this important? Because, a few decades ago - you cannot poll every single person in every single town to understand their needs, wants, and aspirations to hold a forum, analyze, ideate, act, and iterate in such a manner. So, the government was naturally split into many divisions spanning into an authority tree with it's representations. While the fore-fathers can't predict the future to address future needs, they had generally tried their best to address future requirements. But I doubt that forefathers would have been able to prempt the technological advancements of today. And as such we have a necessity to evolve - to go back to the drawing board, and rethink a model of governance with the help of today's technology. Nothing has to be assumed or taken for granted. Be it the President, Prime Minister, or a dicatator - their powers of influence aren't beyond the open, transparent and open-minded community. It has been proven time and again in the technology industry on how transparent, and open-sourced with stewardship, rather than ownership - of ideas, implementations and products have thrived and evoled to become superior. 

Giants behemoths have fallen, and tiny visionaries with the right ideas have taken flight. Linux stands as a stellar example of being the most valuable technology on earth today - which has been the effort of a few visionaries, many companies and an army of individuals combined. It doesn't mean the closed sourcing isn't the right approach - but just rather open sourcing provides a better model for platforms to build on, that are probably require very different models. But.. a modern Government at it's core has to be transparent, and such an open source model is far superior than a closed source approach that's largerly followed today. 

## Why is this even needed?

In order to address that, let's first look at what happens today. Let's say, you as a citizen are unhappy with some specific public service, or there's a law in question that encroaches on a cultural value of a specific community. 

For the sake of the argument, let's take two hypothetical examples for each of the above, drawn from a possible reality. 

- **The highway that you commute on every day is filled with pot holes, and the Government hasn't done much about it**:

[ Try pictorial representation ]

( Points to cover: - Complaints - no action: people don't have a channel to ideate, but just take out their frustration on random conversations with friends, and complain - but to no end - to some it has just become a way of life - and evetually it becomes accepted - that's just how it is; it becomes nothing more than a just waste of time, and energy;  
Complaints - no reciprocation from authorities;  
Complaints - valid reciprocation - but resource constraints;  
Complaint exists - but triaged for more immediate issues - a more open way of triage management is needed) 

- **(.. Use Jallikattu protest .. in more generic form)**:

( Points to cover: - Small triggers, mass disruption, casualty, and wasted time that's could have otherwise been better utilized. It doesn't have to be. If there were better ways, such a need to disrupt life isn't and the expenses incurred due to it are not at all needed. Things can be iteratively, and actively discussed or curbed right in the process, before anything really happening ) 

## What does open sourcing the Government mean?

Open-sourcing is a term largely used in software and technology - but doesn't have to be. Software and technology just reaped the first benefits, and became pioneers in community driven ideation, execution, and governance. And as such we have a large ecosystem, that self-regulates, self-balances with great toolchains to ideate, act, and manage. GitHub, where I write this is a fine example of it - it's quite simply the largest repository of softwares on earth. The closest example to the idea I can think of to communite it to a someone who's not a technology afficiando is the concept of market forces, but with effects that go far beyond, and ways in which it's problems can are curbed off just by the very nature of the system.

So, coming back to the question of what it means to open source the Government - It means that we already have the tools, and ecosystems to conduct governance in a transparent, accountable, and evolutionary way in the open and we have to use them. `It means, every willing citizen can have a role to play in the governance, from their home, office, or on the move - and they have more than just voting rights. To be able to interact, evaluate and be a part of the design in solving problems.` If you think about it, pretty much every aspect of Governance can, and should be transparent, easy to find, and readily available to every single citizen, with perhaps one exception being defence, which has valid reasons to be a black box. With today's technology - filing forms, waiting for days, and wasting time commuting for any information about the Government should and will be ludicrous. So, this spec is about creating such an ecosystem with the community (and the means you) utilizing technology to faciliate such goals. People who are adept in technology also take on the additional responsibility to communicate, share and spread it - due to their better understanding, experience and knowledge with such systems to provide fundamental intuitions, and potential trajectories.

One of my personal beliefs about why the technology industry has taken a spotlight in the recent past and have evolved with much faster pace than any other industry in the world, is simply because of two things:

- **We embrace open-source**: We engage constantly in open source models, respect community driven decisions, and we inherently understand community dynamics to a reasonable extent. As a result, rather than efforts spend on political games - we strive for the end goal together - betterment of the ability to solve a problem - which in-turn gets identified through solid analytics and community driven discovery, while at the same time recognizing the competing and revolutionary ideas - infact, it's common in the technology world to cite their alternative idelogies transparently to promote better informed decisions. There are companies, groups, and individuals decicated to doing all of this in the open.

- **We always assume anything and everything will go wrong**. That's the basics of computer programming - exceptions, error handling, information logs are the foundations of every software. We plan for how to handle failure and fallback scenarios when things fail, rather than you ultimatums on success. While it may sound counter-intuitive to people with opposing ideologies - it helps push boundaries much faster in the longer run. We do so by embracing the unknown, and by just defining success metrics differently. We are infact, tiny biological creatures with physical limitations. It's unrealistic to expect perfection of every single component in any infrastructure. But what can be achieved is perfection of the expectation from a system, and designing systems where fallback components step in to handle failure gracefully with acceptable levels of recoverable damage.

Now with these in mind, the goal is to transfer the knowledge from the technology space into a more generic governance space, and to attempt to apply it to the community.

## Can this even work? 

These problems are not new. It's faced by every industry and every field in some form or the other. But in the technology space, we have made active improvements on how to solve it, and there are projects that work with diverse set of people across the world - co-existly in very productive ways. We've masted the art of co-ordinating effectively in large teams without geographical limitations and restrictions. I feel that's something that has to be applied to every industry, but most importantly to the Government. 

That being said, can this even work? This is one of the things where we have to start taking different approaches to thinking, that might leave a few unsettled, those who are used to the comfort of only dealing with predictablity. It's easy to say this will work, and just do it. Much, like how a lot of Government activities, other than perhaps some elite and resourceful organizations that work with solid data driven metrics, function today. But I say we shouldn't function that way. So, the answer to the question is - we have no way to know - until we try it. But we can definitely make it work - if we do it together.
